Below each image\\nwe show the true label, and a distribution over the top 5 predicted labels. If the true\\nlabel is in the top 5, its probability bar is colored red. Predictions are generated by a\\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) called “AlexNet” (??). From Figure 4 of [KSH12].\\nUsed with kind permission of Alex Krizhevsky.
