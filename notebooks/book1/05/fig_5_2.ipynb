    "(a) ROC curves for two hypothetical classification systems. The red curve for system A is better than the blue curve for system B. We plot the true positive rate (TPR) vs the false positive rate (FPR) as we vary the threshold $\\tau $. We also indicate the equal error rate (EER) with the red and blue dots, and the area under the curve (AUC) for classifier B by the shaded area. Generated by [roc_plot.ipynb](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/05/roc_plot.ipynb). (b) A precision-recall curve for two hypothetical classification systems. The red curve for system A is better than the blue curve for system B. Generated by [pr_plot.ipynb](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/05/pr_plot.ipynb)."
