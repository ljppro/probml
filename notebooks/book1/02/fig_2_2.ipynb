    "(a) Plot of the cdf for the standard normal, $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Generated by [gauss_plot.ipynb](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/gauss_plot.ipynb). (b) Corresponding pdf. The shaded regions each contain $\\alpha /2$ of the probability mass. Therefore the nonshaded region contains $1-\\alpha $ of the probability mass. The leftmost cutoff point is $\\Phi ^{-1}(\\alpha /2)$, where $\\Phi $ is the cdf of the Gaussian. By symmetry, the rightmost cutoff point is $\\Phi ^{-1}(1-\\alpha /2)=-\\Phi ^{-1}(\\alpha /2)$. Generated by [quantile_plot.ipynb](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/quantile_plot.ipynb)."
